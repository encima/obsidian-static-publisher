# Obsidian Static Publisher

This is based on the sample plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

An Obsidian plugin to put any files with `published: true` in the frontmatter into the specified S3 bucket. Current default is to follow and create the folder structure as it is in your vault.

Designed to be used with something like [Markdown-Page](https://github.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-page) to host a static knowledge base site that is manually synced (maybe automatically at some point).
